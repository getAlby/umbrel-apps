  Maybe is a fully (your finances are secure) open-source OS for your personal finances built by
  a small team alongside an incredible community.


  This is an early access release of Maybe that is only available to those who self-host.
  Maybe is under active development and is still working towards a stable release with a full feature set.


  🛠️ MULTI-CURRENCY SUPPORT


  Most currently available features will work out of the box. However, Maybe requires a Synth API key if you would like to use multi-currency support.

  1. Sign up for a Synth API key at https://synthfinance.com/

  2. Add your Synth API key to the .env file at ~/umbrel/app-data/maybe/.env
releaseNotes: >-
  This update introduces a "self resolution" issue tracking system and improvements to property and vehicle accounts:

    - Users can now input details for their property and vehicle accounts
    - In the future, Maybe will support data providers for automatic valuation of properties and vehicles
    - Estimated market values will be added periodically as "Valuations" in the value tab of each account
    - Account balance history graphs will reflect these valuations
